'''
Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words 
as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and 
sorting them alphanumerically. Suppose the following input is 
supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world

Your program should take in only one line of input.

You may assume that your program will only be tested
with valid inputs.
